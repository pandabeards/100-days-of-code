# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued freecodecamp.org ES6 lessons, learned the basics of using Git, and filled out some .json design tokens.

**Thoughts:** The ES6 lessons are a nice video-less break from the full-stack course. Had to get a friend's help figuring out how to clone the forked repo... I must have spent a solid half hour trying to figure it out, and of course it was a simple fix. Grateful for the help. The design tokens are for a work-related design system, but it's helping add to the familiarity.


### Day 2: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** More freecodecamp.org ES6 challenges on template literals and constructor functions.

**Thoughts:** Definitely struggling on this one. Repeating exercises to make sure I understand the syntax(es).
